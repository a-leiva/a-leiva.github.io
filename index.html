    Hello world

<p>
    My name is Andrés Leiva, and I am a student at the University of Florida. This site is for one of my courses, MMC 3260.

<h3>
    Tags, attributes and value pairs
</h3>
<p>
    Let's try inserting a 
    <a href=http://google.com target="_blank" title="Google">link into this paragraph.</a>
    This is an example of an absolute URL: a link that includes the full path to an object, 
    typically using "http://".
</p>
<h3>
    Code block
</h3>
<p>
    If I wanted to type code to read I would use the code tag. For example, 
    <code> 
        href="http://google.com" target="_blank"
    </code>
</p>
<h3>
    Internal links
</h3>
<p>
    An internal link is a link that leads to an object hosted on the web server itself.
